#### Generate an application !heading

Run `ng g @nx/angular:app my-app` to generate an application.

> You can also use Nx Console to generate libraries as well.

When using [Nx](https://nx.dev/), you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

After the app has been generated, use tags in `nx.json` and `.eslintrs.json` to impose constraints on the dependency graph. [Nx Tags](https://nx.dev/structure/monorepo-tags)

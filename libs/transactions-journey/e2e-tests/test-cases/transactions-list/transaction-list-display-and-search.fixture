Feature: Transactions List Display and Search
  As a user
  I want to view and search through my transactions list
  So that I can find specific transactions and verify the list is complete

  Background:
    Given I am on the transactions list page
    And I have access to my transaction history

  Scenario: View complete transactions list
    When I open the transactions list page
    Then I should see a list of transactions
    And the number of transactions should match my transaction history count

  Scenario Outline: Search transactions by term
    When I enter "<search_term>" in the search field
    Then I should see "<expected_count>" transactions in the list
    And the first transaction should match the expected details:
      | Field        | Value                    |
      | Recipient    | <recipient>              |
      | Date         | <date>                   |
      | Amount       | <amount>                 |
      | Account      | <account_number>         |

    Examples:
      | search_term | expected_count | recipient      | date          | amount    | account_number|

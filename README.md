# Golden Sample Angular App

This example project is a reference implementation to showcase a number of best practices to use when building a new Angular SPA that leverages Backbase components and libraries. The project is regularly updated, so come back often to check for new improvements.

# !important

On some AWS environments, due to specific WAF configuration, you might need to use `http://0.0.0.0:4200/` when accessing the app locally, in order to successfully authenticate.

## Authentication details

### Prerequisites:

- Go through the [documentation page](https://community.backbase.com/documentation/foundation_angular/latest/authenticate_users) first to avoid any confusion with implementing authentication in the modelless app

### Important!

The code that is used for authentication is not for production purposes, this is the example to understand the concepts lying under the hood.
Do not copy-paste anything related to the authentication to your banking application.

### How to add authentication to your app

See the example code in the `app.module.ts`, the related `AuthConfig` in the `environment.ts` files, and the `APP_INITIALIZER` provider logic.
Secure routes with `AuthGuard`s. We rely on https://github.com/manfredsteyer/angular-oauth2-oidc, check their documentation for more details.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Running with docker

Run `ng build --configuration production` and then `docker-compose up` to startup the docker container with the application

## Package as a runnable Docker container

Run `ng build:docker` (after a successful build with `ng build`) to create a Docker image. Start a new container with `npm run start:docker`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

## Adding capabilities to your workspace

Nx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.

These capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.

Below are our core plugins:

- [Angular](https://angular.io)
  - `ng add @nrwl/angular`
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
  - `ng add @nrwl/react`
- Web (no framework frontends)
  - `ng add @nrwl/web`
- [Nest](https://nestjs.com)
  - `ng add @nrwl/nest`
- [Express](https://expressjs.com)
  - `ng add @nrwl/express`
- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
  - `ng add @nrwl/node`

There are also many [community plugins](https://nx.dev/community) you could add.

## Generate an application

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:app my-app` to generate an application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

## Generate a library

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are shareable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@backbase/mylib`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng g component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.

## Build

Run `ng build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test my-app` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

## Understand your workspace

Run `nx dep-graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.

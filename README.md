# Golden Sample Angular App

This example project is a reference implementation to showcase a number of best practices to use when building a new Angular SPA that leverages Backbase components and libraries. The project is regularly updated, so come back often to check for new improvements.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Package as a runnable Docker container

Run `ng build:docker` after a successful build to create a Docker image). Start a new container with `npm run start:docker`.
